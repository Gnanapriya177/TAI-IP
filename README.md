Description:
This Python code defines a simple number guessing game. Here's the working of the code :
1) A random number between ( 1 to 50 ) is generated using the random.randint(1, 50) function.
2) The user is prompted to guess the level of the game, If the level is easy you have 10 attempts and if it is hard you have 5 attempts to guess the number right.
3)  Now, the user starts guessing the number, if the number is correct it prints "Your guess is right". If the number is incorrect and attemps > 0 the code gives a hint but if the number is incorrect and attempts = 0 then it prints "You are out of guesses... you lose". The code Terminates.
